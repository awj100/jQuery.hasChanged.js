# jQuery.hasChanged.js
Other jQuery plugins can be used to indicate when a form has been modified (*i.e.*, when a form is "dirty"), whereas **jQuery.hasChanged** will highlight by the addition of a CSS class *which* form fields have been modified.

## Usage
Simply add a call to `hasChanged` on any jQuery selecter:

```
$(":input").hasChanged();
```

#### Notes on usage
* Although **jQuery.hasChanged** works only on `<input type="checkbox|radio|text">`, `<select>` and `<textarea>` elements, it also fully supports chaining on *all* elements returned by the specified selecter, whether or not **jQuery.hasChanged** is running on them.
* **jQuery.hasChanged** does not yet support `<select>` elements implementing the `multiple` attribute.

## Options
**jQuery.hasChanged** can be used as-is, though it does expose a couple of options:
* `cssClass`: a string value denoting the CSS class which should be used to indicate a modified field value. Default: "*has-changed*".
* `dataKey`: **jQuery.hasChanged** stores the original value of each monitored field by using jQuery's [data](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/) method. This is a conventional approach to storing a hidden value using a key-value pair. However, in some rare cases the developer may wish to change the key - perhaps this key conflicts with some other JavaScript or the developer wishes to combine purposes. In virtually all use cases this key will not need to be modified. Default: "*orig-val*".

#### Example
The following snippet demonstrates how to add **jQuery.hasChanged** to all relevant form elements while also specifying that the CSS class "*modified*" should be used to indicate a modified field value:

```
$(":input").hasChanged({
	cssClass: "modified"
});
```

*In case it's new to you, [`:input`](https://api.jquery.com/input-selector/) is a standard jQuery selecter.*
